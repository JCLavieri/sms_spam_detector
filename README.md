# SMS Spam Detector

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to classify SMS text messages as either 'spam' or 'ham' (not spam). It uses a Linear Support Vector Classification (SVC) model trained on a dataset of labeled messages. The project includes a web interface created with Gradio, allowing users to input messages and receive instant classification results.

## Features
- Data processing and model training using scikit-learn's pipeline.
- Text classification using Linear SVC.
- A user-friendly web interface using Gradio for real-time predictions.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install the required packages:

## Usage
To run the SMS Spam Detector, execute the Jupyter Notebook `gradio_sms_text_classification.ipynb`. The Gradio interface will be available at a local URL for testing and interaction.
